Project Title: SoilSense 
Group Number: 8
Team Members: Alphin Shajan, Maryam Elashmawy 

Sensor: 
Soil Moisture Sensors 
Temperature Sensor

Abstract: Watering plants and keeping the right temperature around the plant is essential to their growth, but sometimes it becomes difficult to know whether the plant has enough water in the soil or if it is in an optimal temperature environment. Introducing the SoilSense, which simplifies this by using a soil moisture sensor to monitor the soil moisture levels in real time. On top of that we use a temperature sensor to check the surrounding temperature. The system notifies users through an LCD display which is connected to arduino uno, whenever the soil becomes too dry or whenever the temperature reaches an unfavorable level. The sensors will detect the water content in the soil and once the water content is below a set threshold you will know it's time to water your plant. 

Scenario: This project is ideal for plant lovers who want a more efficient way of taking care of their plants. Not knowing if your plant is healthy can be frustrating but SoilSense can help by monitoring soil moisture and temperature levels and providing these results on the LCD display so you can know when conditions become less than ideal. With this easy-to-read display on an LCD screen, SoilSense helps users ensure their plants remain healthy without needing to connect to a smartphone.
